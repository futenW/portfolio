        <ol>
          <li><b>How do you rate the ease of use with the microwave on a scale of 1-6 with 1 being the hardest to use/understand and 6 being the easiest? Why?</b></li>
          <br>
          - All answered 5. The buttons are worn down, so it’s hard to read the labels. Microwave beeps too many times when it’s finished. Didn’t know you could add 4 minutes directly
          <br><br>
          - Only know how to use one button, the “add 30 seconds” button. There are marks on the button from other people using it many times, and so it’s easy to know which button to press
          <br><br>
          <li><b>Is there anything you liked about the interface?</b></li>
          <br>
          - The “add 30 seconds” button is useful<br><br>
          - Everything’s clearly labeled (except the buttons that are worn out)
          <br><br>
          <li><b>Did you have any difficulties with the interface?</b></li>
          <br>
          - Finger marks help to distinguish which buttons to press. Maybe if they weren’t there, it would be more difficult to know what to do to make it work
          <br><br>
          - Difficult reading the buttons with worn labels
          <br><br>
          <li><b>Is there anything you wish the interface had that would make it easier to use/interact with?</b></li>
          <br>
          - Very pronounced add 30 seconds button.
          <br><br>
          - Ability to pre-save one-and-a-half-minute cook time because often used
          <br><br>
          <li><b>Was the product navigation as you expected?</b></li>
          <br>
          - Yes
          <br><br>
          - It adds 30 seconds when the “add 30 seconds” button is pressed
        </ol>
        <br>
        <b>Main accessibility issue:</b> Overused buttons have the plastic fraying, making it hard to see what the labels say. This may make the microwave harder to use for first-time/infrequent users
        <br><br>
        Person 1:
        <ul style="margin-top: 0px">
          <li>Presses start button a lot, multiple times even though microwave already started</li>
          <li>Uses with relative ease, easily finds right button (number to press)</li>
          <li>Doesn’t come pick up food when done</li>
        </ul>
        Person 2:
        <ul style="margin-top: 0px">
          <li>Opens door, leaves it open while pouring milk</li>
          <li>Presses one minute button before adding 30 seconds</li>
          <li>Doesn’t use start button, so microwave starts while still adding time</li>
          <li>Stands by microwave while waiting for milk to heat</li>
          <li>Presses cancel button</li>
        </ul>
        Person 3:
        <ul style="margin-top: 0px">
          <li>Hand hovers over back and forth between buttons</li>
          <li>Then pressed a lot of buttons</li>
          <li>Eventually reset to starting point</li>
          <li>Difficulty finding start button</li>
          <li>First set cook time, power level, then press start</li>
          <li>Pressed cancel button</li>
          <li>Cleared pretty quickly</li>
          <li>Set clock on microwave relatively quickly in contrast</li>

        <b>Figure 1: </b>Hungry Hank is a famished college senior studying biomedical engineering. He’s rushing to finish his capstone project with his team on a snowy day where they cannot meet in-person. Hank lives off frozen food in his fridge, so he heavily relies on microwaves to heat his food. However, Hank is constantly in a rush, and he mindlessly uses the microwave. More focused on his schoolwork at hand, Hank doesn’t always pay the closest attention to the controls of the microwave interface or stand by to wait for his food to heat.

        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">“What’s taking him so long?”</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">“What’s taking it so long?”</p>

        <b>Figure 2: </b>Rordon Gamsay is a single father of two with two full-time jobs, trying his best to support his family. Rordon rushes home every night to pick up his children from childcare and prepare dinner for them. With his hectic schedule, Rordon rarely has time to prepare a proper meal in time, and instead frequently uses the microwave for everything. Because of this, Rordon’s microwave is quite beat up, and it is hard to see what the buttons say anymore.
        <br>
        <br><br>
        Thinks:
        <br><br>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">“C’mon, one more minute… why won’t this hurry up”</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">“Where are the directions to this lasagna?”</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">“He looks rather sick, I should take his temperature after this”</p>
        <br>
        Feels:
        <br><br>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Hungry, but determined to feed his children</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Stressed and tired from a full day of work</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Burdened to provide his children with a better life</p>

        Says:

        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">“Sit tight, it’s almost done”</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">“Could you hand me the oven mitts?”</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">“Oh shoot, it’s undercooked”</p>
        <br>
        Does:
        <br><br>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Presses the wrong button frequently</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Takes one dish out and immediately puts the next one in</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Forgets to close the microwave door</p>
        <br>
        Personas primarily differ in age and stage of life. Rordon Gamsay, as an adult with dependents, has needs beside his own to look out for, while Hank’s direction in life is primarily goal-oriented towards personal achievement. Compared to me, Hank is rather similar in that I am also a student without dependents, while Rordon Gamsay is more demographically different from me.
