        <p class="subtitle"><i>Prototyping and web design</i> | Spring 2024</p>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website and hone the 
          skills necessary to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface.
          By creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, the groundwork will 
          be laid to build a responsive website based on those prototypes.
        </p>
        <div>This project aims to:</div>
        <div style="margin-top: 7px; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 35px">
          1) evaluate websites for their accessibility, visual design, responsiveness, and usability, <br>
          2) brainstorm and complete a cycle of the design process from sketches to high fidelity, <br>
          3) learn how to make a responsive website through HTML/CSS, and <br>
          4) communicate design decisions and implementation process effectively via case study.

        <h2 class="heading">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px">
          A low-fidelity wireframe is a basic, simplified representation of a digital interface or product. It is typically created early 
          in the design process to quickly and efficiently explore ideas and concepts without getting bogged down in detail. 
          Low-fidelity wireframes focus on the structure and layout of the interface rather than visual design elements like colors, 
          typography, or images.
        </p>
        <p class="caption"><b style="color: #9d9d9d">Figure 2: </b><i>Low-fidelity desktop view</i></p>
        <img src="./assets_rr/lfw1.jpeg" style="width: 900px;"/>
        <p class="caption"><b style="color: #9d9d9d">Figure 3: </b><i>Low-fidelity mobile view</i></p>
        <img src="./assets_rr/lfw2.jpeg" style="width: 600px;"/>
        <p class="caption"><b style="color: #9d9d9d">Figure 4: </b><i>Low-fidelity tablet view</i></p>
        <img src="./assets_rr/lfw3.jpeg" style="width: 900px;"/>
        <p>
          Overall, low-fidelity wireframes serve as a foundational step in the design process, helping designers 
          to quickly visualize and iterate on ideas before investing time and resources into higher-fidelity 
          prototypes and designs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Visual Style Guide</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px">
          A visual style guide in UI/UX design is a comprehensive document that outlines the visual elements and guidelines 
          for maintaining consistency in the design of a digital product or interface. It serves as a reference for designers, 
          developers, and other stakeholders involved in the creation and maintenance of the product.
        </p>
        <img src="./assets_rr/vdg.png" style="width: 900px;"/>
        <p>
          By providing a unified set of visual guidelines, a style guide helps ensure consistency across different screens and 
          interactions within a product, which ultimately improves the user experience and strengthens the brand identity.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2 class="heading">High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px">
          A high-fidelity wireframe is a detailed representation of a digital interface or product that closely resembles the final design. 
          Unlike low-fidelity wireframes, which are simple and focus on structure and layout, high-fidelity wireframes include visual 
          design elements such as colors, typography, and images. They provide a more polished and realistic depiction of the interface, 
          allowing designers to communicate their design vision more effectively and accurately. 
        </p>
        <p class="caption"><b style="color: #9d9d9d">Figure 5: </b><i>High-fidelity desktop view</i></p>
        <img src="./assets_rr/hfw1.png" style="width: 900px;"/>
        <p class="caption"><b style="color: #9d9d9d">Figure 6: </b><i>High-fidelity mobile view</i></p>
        <img src="./assets_rr/hfw2.png" style="width: 400px;"/>
        <p class="caption"><b style="color: #9d9d9d">Figure 7: </b><i>High-fidelity tablet view</i></p>
        <img src="./assets_rr/hfw3.png" style="width: 700px;"/>
        <p>
          A high-fidelity mockup represents the polished, final look of the product wishes to achieve. 
          It employs the components and colors included in the visual style guide. 
          Overall, high-fidelity wireframes play a crucial role in the design process by helping designers communicate 
          their design vision, gather feedback, and create a more accurate representation of the final product 
          before moving on to prototyping and development.
