        <p>We all have digital products that we love. But what makes one application more useful than another and what makes one website easier to use than its 
          competitor? In this study, we narrow down on three widely used photo-collection applications and factors that differentiate the products in terms of intrinsic 
          utility and external features.
        </p>

          The objectives of this project are to:

          1) conduct competitive analysis between competitor companies, <br>
          2) identify strengths and weaknesses in design elements employed by industry designers, and <br>

          As part of the research process, one good practice for designers is competitive analysis—a method to 
          understand and get a basis for how other organizations are designing their products or interfaces for guidance. 
          Here, I do an analysis between Google Photos, Samsung Gallery, and Apple Photos, specifically regarding their favoriting function.

          The favoriting icon for Samsung Gallery and Apple Photos was both a heart, whereas Google Photos utilized a star. 
          The use of a heart seems most intuitive, as the heart symbolizes affection and the emotion of love or satisfaction, 
          most commonly associated with the attraction towards a particular person or object. The use of a heart to signify the 
          button for favoriting a photo is well-suited for the functionality not only in terms of real-world symbolism, but also 
          in terms of common digital usage; the heart is commonly used for buttons representing “like” features on social media 
          apps and websites.

        <p style="margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 35px">
          The usage of a star in Google Photos seems less adept for the task, as it remains ambiguous as to 
          what a star may represent in a given digital platform. It was not until I read the “Favorites” tab next to the star 
          icon in the menu section that I arrived at the certainty that the star icon represented “favorites” functionality in 
          Google Photos.

        <p style="margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: 35px;">
          Additionally, the choice of fill color in the favorited icons between the apps draws contrast in status 
          designation. In Samsung Gallery, the favorited photos fill the heart red, whereas Google Photos and Apple Photos keep 
          the fill white, the same color as the icon outline. The contrast between the fill color in Samsung Gallery helps to 
          enunciate the difference between favorited photos and not favorited photos.

          Google Photos and Samsung Gallery include the added labeling of dates above each photo or group of photos taken on 
          the same day, whereas Apple Photos and Samsung Gallery leave this labeling out. This labeling by date seems to 
          enhance context behind the thumbnail photos, as many of the photos are likely taken at vastly differing times in 
          one’s history; the inclusion of the dates adds an extra layer of information to the long list of images and allows 
          the user to draw greater recall to the time the photo(s) were taken. Even the simple addition of a year to a photo 
          taken many years ago may amplify the user’s sense of nostalgia as to what was going on at that particular time in life. 
          The omission of this feature by Apple Photos gives the effect of condensing all the favorited photos into a single 
          list of tiny thumbnails, presenting little contrast to the different photos.

        <h2 class="heading">List of features</h2>
        <ul style="margin: 5px;">
          <li>Intuitive icon symbolism (i.e. heart for liking/favoriting)</li>
          <li>Distinction between groups in the aggregator (i.e. grouping by date)</li>
          <li>Ability to sort and filter items in the aggregator</li>
          <li>Intuitive default ordering in the aggregator (i.e. by date, price, alphabetically, etc.)</li>

        <h2 class="heading">Intention of App</h2>
        <span style="margin: 0px;">I am building an app that accumulates memories of one's past through the collage of photos taken at different points in one's life. 
          Each photo is labeled with a year to commemorate the event captured at that point in time. The memories can then be labeled as a "favorite" if they
          hold especial value to the user, and the "favorited" photos are collected in a separate category according to the aggregator functionality while
          still remaining in the original collection. The dates of the photos can also be filtered through limitation of the maximum year allowed to be displayed 
          or the minimum year allowed to be displayed. Additionally, the photos can be sorted in ascending order according to year.
        </span>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="heading">Takeaways</h2>
        <span>Building a webapp is harder than it looks. Even small features like an aggregator, whether in a shopping cart or in a photo collection system, takes much 
          background logic and much more algorithmic coding than anticipated. Such comes the beauty of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue--these frontend frameworks 
          combine the foundations of vanilla JavaScript with the necessary mental models of more complex backend development 
          to form a well-tempered system of developing dynamic visual interfaces.
        </span>
        <br><br>
        <span>
          Small design choices like what shape to make an icon can have huge impacts--the intuition behind a heart elicits the appropriate mental models for the 
          functionality behind the button; a poor choice of iconography can aversely affect the intuitiveness behind the practicality of a feature, and small design 
          choices like these can add up. In other words, careful thought for the small details goes a long way.
